    	  <h3>The stress of the chase: finding the data to put your mind at ease</h3>
            
            <p>The education team started off with a lot of questions. Questions like what’s AYP? What datasets are usable? Where did the girl scouts start? The answer, by the way, is Savannah Georgia.</p>

            <p>After many hours, sticky notes and a graveyard of sour straw wrappers the education team settled on an idea.</p>

            <p>The team would  create a prototype tool to examine the spatial and temporal trends in education, specifically the school performance measured by state test scores and poverty defined by the percentage of student eligible for free or reduced lunch.</p>

            <p>The greatest challenge and cause of anxiety building the prototype was finding consistent data. The plan was  to use free and reduced lunch data to show poverty levels, but with shifting data collection methods the group could only find the last two years. Not amazing.</p>

            <p>The lack of depth in data caused a fair amount of stress, which was especially apparent in Fedor. As a data reporter himself and the team’s contact with the Oregonian,  Fedor was visibly nervous about the team’s progress. It didn’t didn’t go unnoticed by the group. At one point other group members joked about creating a separate data visualization of his stress level throughout the project. </p>

            <p>With heavy hearts the education team planned to find a different metric and shift the focus of the story once again, until Allysa changed our approach. She called the Oregon Department of Education and talked to  several people until she found over a decade of the data that the team gave up on. The human contact gave us data on Oregon’s school lunch program, a key layer for our story and relief for Fedor.</p>

            <p>Once we had the missing data attitudes had shifted. Fedor was no longer nervous about the project. </p>

            <p>Around 4:30 p.m. on Friday I asked Erin, talented geographer and data analyst, what she was doing. With a smile Erin responded that she was trying not to panic.</p>

            <p>“I don’t see what everyone’s worried about,” Fedor said to the group. “Everything is fine.” </p>

            <p>This was not the Fedor from the day before. </p>

            <p>When I asked him what changed, Fedor said that having the free and reduced lunch data finally put him at ease.</p>

            <p>“Now that we have it I feel like we have a stable metric to run performance again.”</p>

            <p>He explained that we were trying to find story ideas before we had the data and the tools, which is sort of cheating. That process was causing stress. Once the data was accounted for he was confident that a viable product would follow.</p>
